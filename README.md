### Background 

Climate change is affecting different regions of the world in different ways with varying severity. The polar regions are no exception and are experiencing more rapid change than other areas, with predictions showing increased temperature, from +1.3°C to +4.8°C, and precipitation, from +8% to +31%, on the Antarctic continent by 2100 (Bracegirdle et al., 2020). Changes in temperature regime and other environmental conditions may be indicated by local flora and fauna, such as changes in life cycle and spatial range (Sancho et al., 2019). 	  

Cryptogams (lichens, mosses, and bryophytes) are the primary vegetation in Antarctica (Sancho et al., 2019). Lichens are particularly good for monitoring environmental conditions because they are abundant, with about 400 species occurring over Antarctica and are not confined to wet areas as bryophytes are (Sancho et al., 2019). Lichens closely reflect the climate, so may act as a key indicator to track climate change into the future (Sancho et al., 2019). 

Light, water, and temperature are known to be the primary influences on lichen carbon assimilation (Palmquist, 2000). In this experiment, I will manipulate the levels of these factors to determine lichen productivity under different light, water, and temperature conditions. I expect water content to have the largest effect, followed by light and then temperature. The results from this will hopefully elucidate how Antarctic vegetation will respond to future climate change and provide a way to estimate carbon assimilation rates for a particular species based on environmental conditions. 
 

### Methods 

#### Location and specimen 

This will be a manipulative lab study. Seven species of lichens and mosses (Chorisodontium aciphyllum, Andreaea gainii, Polytrichum strictum, Stereocaulon alpinum, Sanionia uncinata, Sphaerophorus globosus, Usnea aurantiaco-atra) have previously been collected in January and February 2023 from Robert Island by a PhD student, Charlotte Walshaw. I will choose one of these species to work with, with a minimum of three replicates. 

#### Data collection 

Samples have been frozen since February, so defrosting protocol must be followed before any measurements are taken. Carbon flux measurements will be made using a WALZ GFS-3000. Two response curves will be directly measured: one for photosynthetic response to water content and one for light response. A third curve for temperature will be indirectly measured when producing the initial two curves (and potentially measured directly, depending on the tools and time available). 

For the water content measurements, the sample will be submerged in water and weighed before being placed in a cuvette. I will measure photosynthetic activity at regular intervals, weighing the sample at each measuring point to determine the water content. During the measurement, I will keep temperature, humidity, and light level constant. 

For light response, I will start by measuring photosynthetic activity in the dark, then increasing the light level and measuring at each level. Temperature, humidity, and water content (indicated by mass) will be kept constant. 

The above two measurements will be taken at a range of five to seven temperatures on different days. The order of temperatures will be randomized to avoid acclimation. I will infer the temperature response from this. 

#### Analysis 

I will determine response curves for water content, light, and temperature. I will then plot all of the variables together. I will use weather station data to produce a model of lichen productivity response to changing conditions. I will analyze data in RStudio (RStudio Team, 2020). 
 

### Expected results 

I expect water content to have the strongest influence on photosynthetic activity, followed by light and then temperature (Palmquist, 2000). For water content, I expect an initial increase in photosynthetic activity with increasing water content, followed by a leveling-off period, and then a small decrease in photosynthetic activity at very high water content (Lange et al., 2001). For light, I expect a similar pattern without a significant decrease in activity at high light, as Antarctic lichens are typically subject to high and constant light exposure during the summer due to a lack of shading by nonexistent taller vegetation (Longton, 1988). With temperature, I except activity to increase to an ideal temperature above which activity will decrease—however, lichens are known to acclimate quickly to shifts in temperature (Sancho et al., 2019). 

Overall, I expect to see that projected future conditions in Antarctica (higher temperatures and water availability) to benefit lichen growth rate (Sancho et al., 2019; Bracegirdle et al., 2020; Colesie et al., 2022).|
